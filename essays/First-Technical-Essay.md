## A New Year 

I already had the idea of wanting to do SOMETHING with a computer going into college, but I wasn't quite sure specifically what that was yet when I started my first semester. It wasn't until my second semester when I took a class in Java that I figured that I really liked programming. The process of putting something together yourself, breaking it, fixing the problem, and eventually get it working filled me with a sense of satisfaction, and that I feel like this is something I could do for the rest of my life. I'm not good with my hands, so I figured that this is the next best thing. After getting my associate's in software development, I finally decided I specifically wanted to do web development. Web development seems like the perfect choice. It's a skill in high demand, I get to build stuff, and it's on my computer.

## Java vs. Javascript

From my research, it seems like Javascript and React is all the rage nowadays for building web applications. I've only had a very brief overview of Javascript in one of my classes, but we didn't go very deep into it because we were learning three other languages at the time. I also have never heard of React until very recently, up until about a year ago as I was scroling through Youtube videos on the subject. Github also seems like the main platform for collaborating on projects. The only experience I've had with Github was downloading Half-Life mods and looking at their source code, but that was about it.

## A New Style of Learning

A big part of why I've found this class so stressful is the transition from a more "traditional" style of learning to an "athletic" one. The pacing of this course is absolutely killing me at the moment, but I believe I will eventually find a schedule that I can stick to. As I've mentioned before, I am still transitioning from hanging out with friends every day and staying up all night to having a very busy schedule all of the sudden. Just the idea of having something due almost every day fills me with anxiety, but at the same time, I really enjoy learning the material (something 17 year old me would've never said!).

## Final Remarks
To recap, Javascript is a much more convienent language compared to other languages I've dabbled in. This new style of learning is... Different. It's definitely not the way I'm used to learning. More to come.
