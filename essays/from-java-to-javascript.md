*Difficulty: a thing that is hard to accomplish, deal with, or understand.*

This first week of classes has easily been one of the most stressful weeks of my college career so far. I am still bouncing back from "vacation" mode, meaning I'm still figuring out my workflow and readjusting to a "normal" sleep schedule. I have only been focusing on Javascript this past week, and I still have no idea when I can start working on other classes. Despite all of that though, I can easily see myself enjoying learning more as time goes on. I feel like I'm learning more "real world" skills such as creating a professional portfolio, and hopefully creating a high quality, "professional" website by the end of the semester. As someone who sees myself being a web developer in the future, the stress I'm experiencing now might pay off in the end.

## Java vs. Javascript

Other than the name, Java and Javascript are two completely different languages. For one, Java isn't strongly typed, and variables will accept any values you assign them as, and this took some getting used to. For example, I kept declaring my increment variables for loops as an integer, rather than just using the let keyword. Another big difference is the fact that Javascript runs in a browser, whereas Java needs an external IDE to run, such as JGrasp or VSCode. The convienence of not needing to download any external software to start coding is a massive advantage Javascript has over Java, considering how I'm the type of person who wants to take the least amount of steps possible to accomplish a task.

## A New Style of Learning

A big part of why I've found this class so stressful is the transition from a more "traditional" style of learning to an "athletic" one. The pacing of this course is absolutely killing me at the moment, but I believe I will eventually find a schedule that I can stick to. As I've mentioned before, I am still transitioning from hanging out with friends every day and staying up all night to having a very busy schedule all of the sudden. Just the idea of having something due almost every day fills me with anxiety, but at the same time, I really enjoy learning the material (something 17 year old me would've never said!).

## In the context of relationships

So in the end, we realize that all engineering and programming is there for a reason - to serve human needs. Maybe that's why those things are difficult, because they both involve humans and are for humans.

Relationships, regardless if they're romantic or not take work. Humans are fickle creatures and relationships can come and go with the wind. To properly maintain something over time requires work. Family takes work. Marriage takes work. We live to figure out what works and what doesn't and hope that as we move forward we're improving.

Relationships have always been difficult, and by nature will continue to be so.

## Okay!

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
