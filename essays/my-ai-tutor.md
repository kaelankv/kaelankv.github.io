### I. Introduction
AI has been an extremely helpful tool for me not just for this class, but for a variety of other classes as well. I use AI such as ChatGPT to guide me in the right direction. For example, if I'm writing an essay. I might ask ChatGPT to assist in spelling and grammatical checks, or I might ask it for ideas on what I should research if I don't know where to start. AI has helped me understand software engineering concepts as well such as design patterns and error handling. I have mainly used ChatGPT, but I have recently started using Github Copilot for this class.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

1. In-class Practice WODs
I mainly used ChatGPT to get me started in the right direction and error handling. How I will typically handle a WOD of any sort (practice, in-class, or experiences) is that I'll write as much code as I can by myself, then if there was a particular step or instruction that I didn't fully understand, I would copy and paste that step into ChatGPT and it's usually right about 70% of the time. Sometimes I didn't know what I should be doing at all, so I would explain to ChatGPT what I'm trying to accomplish. It would then give me a general idea of what I should be doing and spit out some code that usually needs some tweaking.

2. In-class WODs
As stated in the previous paragraph, I used ChatGPT to help me get started and for handling errors in my code. Much of what I said in the previous paragraph applies here as well.

3. Essays
ChatGPT was mainly used for spelling and grammar checks, until the very last essay which was to reflect on the design patterns we used throughout the semester. I had no idea what design patterns even were, so I did a little research on them. I found that there were many design patters and I just couldn't wrap my head around them, nor did I really have the time to study all of them and see how it applies to my code. I just simply asked Github Copilot to look through my final project and see if there were any design patterns that I used. It gave me a few patterns called the container component pattern and the module pattern. Tese were patterns that seemed very familiar to me, because it sounded just like OOP.

4. Final project
While ChatGPT was my main "tutor" so to speak, I started using Github Copilot for my final project. Github Copilot's much more useful because it has access to my project and can give me more specific advice. I am responsible for the home page, leaderboard and goals pages and Github Copilot has been invaluable in helping me implement these pages. I mainly used it for the backend portion of the webpages, because backend development is still a bit of a challenge to me. For example, I didn't really understand collections all that well, and the goals page needed a collection of goals that the user would add and modify from. I have been going back and forth with Copilot to help me initialize the collection and how to add and modify goals.

5. Writing code
As mentioned previously, Github Copilot was specifically responsible for the initialization of the collection of goals in my final project. It helped me write the code for adding, modifying and deleting goals from the collection. The code it gave me is very similar to what we learned in the experience WODS so it wasn't too difficult to understand, I just needed a little help getting started.

### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:
I think that ChatGPT and Github Copilot are incredible learning assistant tools, and it can only improve as time goes on. however, I do think that it can be easily misused and people may use it as a "fast pass" towards their goals. This could possibly mean an increase in people getting put into positions where they don't belong, but at the same time I think that it could be a great assistant to others. I had an ICS 111 professor explain to me the concept of the "rubber duck" where people would debug code by speaking to a rubber duck. Sometimes, saying the problem out loud could help you understand the problem better, or the solution might just come to you as you're speaking out loud. Others may use this as a "rubber duck" that talks back to you.

### IV. Practical Applications:
I think I've made my point clear in establishing AI as a good study buddy (at least most of the time, when it's right). Another huge (albeit controversial) use is the use of AI in art. AI models such as Midjourney and DALL-E have been used to create art that looks almost indistinguishable from human art, though there are little things wrong with the art that makes it seem a little uncanny. AI text-to-video is now on the rise, which could present some very serious ethical issues. ]
