Puting Puto at Pitong Duwende (translated to White Puto and the Seven Elves) is a video project I starred in doing a comedic retelling of Snow White in Filipino. It is meant to showcase what we learned in Filipino 101, our video editing skills and how well we can work with ten or so people.

I had a hand in the script writing, acting, and brought my own costume. Because comedy was our focus, I was Snow White and we added some pop culture references to appeal to a more modern audience. We had a time limit of 5 - 6 minutes, so it is only a very brief overview of Snow White.

I learned how to work cohesively as a team member, basic video production skills, and script writing. 

Here is some example code to illustrate Simple Schema use:
