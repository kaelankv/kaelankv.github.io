This is the second PC I've built myself last year after a long awaited upgrade. I designed this with gaming in mind, specifically for Escape from Tarkov, because I figured if my PC can handle that game, it should handle most other games I play.

Here are the specs:

I had upgraded from the following:
- i7 6700k overclocked at 4.6 GHz
- NVidia Geforce GTX 1070ti
- 16 GB DDR4 2133hz RAM
- 2 500 GB HDDs and 1 2 TB SSD

I used a few resources to help me assemble this build, such as: Youtube, PC Building Simulator, and ICS 125 (PC Maintainence and Repair). I learned the basics of a PC and how to put one together.
