A simple rock paper scissors game (or Jan ken po as it's called in certain parts of the world) that matches you up against a CPU. Once the user is finished with the game, the final scores are outputted to a text file called "scores.txt."

This project was meant to teach me about JFrames and handling events. I found this to be the best project in 211 simply because I can actually see what's going on with a GUI.
